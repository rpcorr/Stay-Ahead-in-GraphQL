Mutation is a useful GraphQL operation that is useful.  Mutation are used whenever we need to change data.

Setting a trail status from open to closed

mutation {
  setTrailStatus(id: "goosebumps" status:CLOSED){
    name
    status
  }
}

RETURNS

{
  "data": {
    "setTrailStatus": {
      "name": "Goosebumps",
      "status": "CLOSED"
    }
  }
}

------------------------------------------------------

Another way that we could do this, there is a Trail query. And this will select this individual trail.

query Trail {
  Trail(id: "goosebumps" ) {
    name
    status
  }
}
