An Introduction to GraphQL
==========================

API has provided us with a standard way of geting data and GraphQL gives us a new way of getting data and GraphQL gives us a new way of designing an API to serve up all types of data. 

No matter where your data is, a database, a cloud service a rest API, GraphQL can serve as a wrapper for all of that data.

Big companies like Github, PayPal, Expedia, Facebook, Twitter, and more have made big bets on GraphQL.

GraphQL gives us a query language for asking questions of our data.
