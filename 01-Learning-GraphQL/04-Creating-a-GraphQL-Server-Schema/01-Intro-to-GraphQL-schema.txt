4-1 Introduction the GraphQL schema definition language
-------------------------------------------------------
So far we talked about a couple different pieces of the GraphQL spec. We have talked about the query language, and then we've touched on the schema definition language, which is a language that defines all of our API's types. So in order to send these queries, we need a well-defined schema.  Let's take a closer look at some of the pieces that make up the schema definition language.

In GraphQL there are a few different scalar types.  We can return one of the following:

Int
Boolean
Float
ID
String

So these represent just one little container of data. If a field returns one thing, it's going to return one of these five built-in scalar types.

When we set this up in our schema, it'll look like this:

id: ID!
name: String!

e.g.

type Photo {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  url: String!
  description: String
  rating: Float
  private: Boolean!
}


Nullable vs. Non-Nullable

name: String! - Non-Nullable
description: String - Nullable

All of the queries that are part of our API are going to be wrapped in the query type.


Root Queries:

type Query {
  totalUsers: Int!
}


Fields can return lists, let's say we add a user with a field called posted photos. A user might post more than one photo, so we would return a list, we'd know it's a list because of the square brackets.  Inside of the brackets we have the object type that we want to return.

Lists

type User {
  postedPhotos: [Photo!]!
}


photos: [Photo]   -> Nullable list of nullable values

photos: [Photo]!  -> Non-nullable list of nullable values

photos: [Photo!]! -> Non-nullable list of non-nullable values







query {
  totalDays
}

RESULTS:

{
  "data": {
    "totalDays": -26
  }
}

NOTE: "totalDays": -26 is dummy data generated by mocks: true set in index.js

query {
  totalDays
  allDays {
    id
    date
    mountain    
  }
}

RESULTS

{
  "data": {
    "totalDays": -25,
    "allDays": [
      {
        "id": "6dc93d88-dcb4-4094-8801-396b5c5e5701",
        "date": "Hello World",
        "mountain": "Hello World"
      },
      {
        "id": "4f64f806-219e-4f00-b688-6d087c8237a8",
        "date": "Hello World",
        "mountain": "Hello World"
      }
    ]
  }
}

-----------------------------------------

query  {
  totalDays
  allDays {
    id
    date
    mountain
    conditions
  }
}


RESULT:

{
  "data": {
    "totalDays": 78,
    "allDays": [
      {
        "id": "42528902-26ca-421b-870a-58500c13a146",
        "date": "Hello World",
        "mountain": "Hello World",
        "conditions": "ICE"
      },
      {
        "id": "fcba8b3b-7c5a-41e6-9065-051d22d3b959",
        "date": "Hello World",
        "mountain": "Hello World",
        "conditions": "POWDER"
      }
    ]
  }
