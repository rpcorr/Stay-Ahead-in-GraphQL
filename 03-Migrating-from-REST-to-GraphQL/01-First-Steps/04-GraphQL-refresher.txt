GRAPHQL REFRESHER
=================

Schema and Types
  -> Schema defines the shape of your data
  -> Each property expects a type (for example, string)

  Any properties or data you send or pull to GraphQL expects a type.  The purpose of this type assignment is to prevent any issues when adding new items to the database.

   const schema = buildSchema(`
    type Friend {
        id: ID
        firstName: String
        lastName: String
        gender: String
        language: String
        emails: [Email]!
    }
   `)

Queries and Mutations

type Mutation {
    createFriend( input: FriendInput): Friend
    updateFriend( input: FriendInput): Friend
    deleteFriend(id: ID!): String
}

Another term is mutations. In GraphQL, you query the data or mutate the data. So adding or updating, or even deleting in GraphQL are mutations.
