CREATE THE INITIAL SCHEMA AND TYPE
==================================

Need to set up a schema and define types for each of our properties.

1. First rename models folder to data

2. Create file named "schema.js"

3.  Inside schema.js have:

    import mongoose from 'mongoose';

    const Schema = mongoose.Schema;


4. Create a resolvers file (resolvers.js).  Resolvers are the functions that will make the queries with the database and then return a result inside of GraphQL

5. Create dbConnectors.js file.  Within the file have the following:

import { Schema } from 'mongoose';

export const ContactSchema = new Schema({
  firstName: {
    type: String,
    required: 'Enter a first name',
  },
  lastName: {
    type: String,
    required: 'Enter a last name',
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
  },
  company: {
    type: String,
  },
});
