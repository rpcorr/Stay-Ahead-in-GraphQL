ADD A FEW ITEMS WITH GRAPHIQL
=============================

Let's finalize our server file to make sure that we can take all the information,the schema, the resolvers that we've built, and finalize our GraphQL server.

Within index.js, remove import {buildSchema} from 'graphql';  as it was defined in the schema itself. So, let's import our schema:

import { schema } from './src/data/schema';

remove all code that was used to build the initial GraphQL server.  Also remove the root value because we've passed this inside of our schema as well.

Run the  server.  An error happen initially due to type mutation and not type Mutation within schema.js.

in the browser type the following: 

mutation {
  createContact(input: {
    firstName: "Manny",
    lastName: "Henri",
    email: "me@me.com",
    company: "LinkedIn"
  }) {
    id
    firstName	
  }
}

Another error happened.  To Fix it , within resolvers.js and CreatecreateContact under Mutation we are going to do an async promise instead.


This:

createContact: async (root, { input }) => {
      const newContact = new Contacts({
        firstName: input.firstName,
        lastName: input.lastName,
        email: input.email,
        company: input.company,
      });

      newContact.id = newContact._id;

      try {
        await newContact.save();
        return newContact;
      } catch (err) {
        throw new Error(`Error saving contact: ${err.message}`);
      }


Instead of:

createContact: async (root, { input }) => {
      const newContact = new Contacts({
        firstName: input.firstName,
        lastName: input.lastName,
        email: input.email,
        company: input.company,
      });

      newContact.id = newContact._id;

 return new Promise((resolve) => {
    newContact.save((err) => {
        if (err) reject(err);
        else resolve(newContact);
    });
});
