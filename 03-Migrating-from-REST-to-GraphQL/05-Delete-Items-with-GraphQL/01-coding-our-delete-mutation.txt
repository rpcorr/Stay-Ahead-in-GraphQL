CODING OUR DELETE MUTATION
==========================

What if we wanted to deleted a contact?  Let's go ahead and add the code to create that mutation.


in resolvers.js under Mutation add:

deleteContact: async (root, { id }) => {
    try {
    await Contacts.deleteOne({ _id: id });
    return 'Successfully deleted contact!';
    } catch (err) {
    throw new Error(`Error deleting contact: ${err.message}`);
    }
},


In schema.js under type Mutation add:

type Mutation {
        deleteContact(id: ID!): String
}

This time we have : String as it returns a string and not a contact.
