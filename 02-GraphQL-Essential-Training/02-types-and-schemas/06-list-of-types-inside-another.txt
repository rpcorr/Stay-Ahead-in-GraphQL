List of Types Inside Another
============================

In many cases, you will need to have inside of a field multiple values. For example, a list of episodes characters featured in a TV show.  This is where you can create a type for your list and use an array to signify a list of items inside of a field.  In our case, we already created it for the stores.  You can build on 

type Store {
    store: String 
}

To include an address, etc.
