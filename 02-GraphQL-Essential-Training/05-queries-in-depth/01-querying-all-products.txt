Querying All Products
=====================

Querying all objects in GraphQL is often a need to get a list of items.  Now we need to add a resolver first.

resolvers.js
------------

getAllProducts: async () => {
    try {
      return await Widgets.find({})
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error(error);
    }
  },


  Now we need to add it to our schema and put it in our queries.  It returns an array of Product.

  schema.js
  ---------
  getAllProducts: [Product]


  Go into GraphQL and in the left side have the following:

  query {
  getAllProducts{
    name
    price
    inventory
  }
}

You can put as many fields as you like as you want to show in the results.

{
  "data": {
    "getAllProducts": [
      {
        "name": "Widget",
        "price": 34.99,
        "inventory": null
      },
      {
        "name": "Shovel 2",
        "price": 14.99,
        "inventory": 30
      },
      {
        "name": "Shovel 2",
        "price": 14.99,
        "inventory": 30
      }
    ]
  }
}
